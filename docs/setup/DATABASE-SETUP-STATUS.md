NOTICE:  üìä Created XX tables
NOTICE:  ‚öôÔ∏è  Created XX functions
```

## üîç Verification

After running the script, you can verify the setup by running:

```sql
-- Check tables
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check functions
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY routine_name;

-- Check views
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you get "column does not exist" errors:
- Make sure you're running the complete `SIMPLE-SETUP-NO-CLEANUP.sql` script
- Check that all parts ran successfully

### If you get "policy already exists" errors:
- These are safe to ignore - the script uses `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`
- The policies will be recreated correctly

### If you get "relation already exists" errors:
- These are safe to ignore - the script uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Existing tables won't be modified
